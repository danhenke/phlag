## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop 4.32.0+ (Engine 26.1.1, Compose 2.27+) on macOS or Windows with virtualization enabled (HyperKit on Apple Silicon, WSL¬†2 on Windows).
- Docker Engine 26.0.0+ with the Compose plugin 2.27+ on Linux; install the `docker-compose-plugin` package provided by your distribution.
- BuildKit enabled for modern Dockerfile syntax. Add the following to `~/.docker/config.json` (see Docker documentation) or export `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` before building:

    ```json
    {
        "features": {
            "buildkit": true
        }
    }
    ```

Need more detail? The troubleshooting guide in [`doc/docker-troubleshooting.md`](./doc/docker-troubleshooting.md) covers version checks, disk space tips, and recovery steps.

### 1. Clone & install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danhenke/phlag.git
cd phlag
composer install
```

### 2. Create a local environment file

Define the runtime configuration expected by the application:

```bash
cat <<EOF > .env.local
APP_NAME=Phlag
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true
POSTGRES_DB=phlag
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_URL=pgsql:host=postgres;port=5432;dbname=${POSTGRES_DB}
REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
EOF
```

Load the variables into your shell whenever you start a new terminal:

```bash
set -a
source .env.local
set +a
```

### 3. Start Docker Compose stack

Ensure Docker Desktop (or another Docker engine) is running, then bring up the full stack defined in `compose.yaml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

This launches three services within an isolated Docker network:

-   `app` ‚Äî PHP runtime serving HTTP on port 80 and talking to backing services via Docker DNS.
-   `postgres` ‚Äî PostgreSQL database available only on the Compose network.
-   `redis` ‚Äî Redis cache available only on the Compose network.

Only the application‚Äôs port 80 is published to your LAN (`http://localhost/` by default).

Logs remain on stdout; tail them with `docker compose logs -f` when debugging. The Compose file configures the `json-file` driver with `max-size=10m` and `max-file=5`, so each container keeps a rotating local buffer without requiring extra volumes.

### 4. Run migrations and seed data

Execute CLI commands inside the `app` container so they share networking and environment context. Helper scripts wrap
`docker compose exec` for the common admin tasks when your stack is running detached:

```bash
./scripts/app-migrate --seed
# or when you just need to reload demo data
./scripts/app-seed --fresh
```

The seeders provision a reusable dataset:

-   Project `demo-project` with Production (default) and Staging environments.
-   Feature flags `checkout-redesign` and `homepage-recommendations`.
-   Sample evaluation and audit records that exercise the schema.

### 5. Verify the HTTP endpoint and CLI

-   Visit `http://localhost/` to confirm the container is serving traffic.
-   List available console commands from inside the container:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec app php phlag list
    ```

### Optional: Share a pre-built image

If a teammate needs a ready-to-run container, follow the workflows in `doc/docker-image-sharing.md`.
They cover exporting the locally built `phlag-app` image as a `.tar` archive or publishing it to a registry
such as GHCR with traceable tags.

> Full examples are available in `/postman/FeatureFlagService.postman_collection.json`.

### Example: Exchange an API key for a JWT

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url http://localhost/v1/auth/token \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
         "project": "demo-project",
         "environment": "production",
         "api_key": "<project-api-key>"
     }'
```

```json
{
    "token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9...",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "project": "demo-project",
    "environment": "production"
}
```

### Example: List seeded projects and environments

After running the demo seeders you can inspect the REST payloads with a simple `curl`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'http://localhost/v1/projects' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt>'
```

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "11111111-1111-4111-9111-111111111111",
            "key": "demo-project",
            "name": "Phlag Demo Project",
            "description": "Sample project used to showcase feature flag workflows.",
            "metadata": {
                "owner": "demo@phlag.test",
                "timezone": "UTC"
            },
            "environments": [
                {
                    "id": "22222222-2222-4222-9222-222222222222",
                    "key": "production",
                    "name": "Production",
                    "is_default": true
                },
                {
                    "id": "33333333-3333-4333-9333-333333333333",
                    "key": "staging",
                    "name": "Staging",
                    "is_default": false
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example: Evaluate a feature flag for a user

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'http://localhost/v1/evaluate?project=demo-project&env=production&flag=checkout-redesign&user_id=user-123&country=US&segment=beta-testers' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt>'
```

```json
{
    "flag": "checkout-redesign",
    "variant": "variant",
    "rollout": 75,
    "reason": "matched_segment_rollout",
    "request_context": {
        "country": "US",
        "segment": "beta-testers"
    }
}
```

---

## üîê Authentication

-   JWT bearer tokens issued via `/v1/auth/token` using project API key.
-   Include header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
    ```
-   Tokens are scoped to project + environment.

## üß∞ CLI Commands (Laravel Zero)

| Command                          | Purpose                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `app:migrate [--fresh] [--seed]` | Run database migrations |
| `app:seed [--fresh]`             | Seed demo data          |
| `app:hello`                      | Print a hello message   |

Run commands through the Laravel Zero binary inside the running container via the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/app-cli app:migrate
```

### Example: Run migrations and seed the demo dataset

Use the helper to execute Laravel Zero commands in the app container and mirror what CI does before tests run:

```bash
./scripts/app-migrate --seed
```

This wraps `docker compose exec app php phlag app:migrate --seed` and surfaces the same confirmation messages you would see by running the binary directly:

```
Database migrations completed.
Database seeding completed.
```

### Example: Refresh demo data from a clean schema

```bash
./scripts/app-seed --fresh
```

The command drops and recreates the schema before seeding so you always have the canonical records from `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`:

```
Database seeding completed.
```

### Example: Verify the CLI wiring inside the container

Use the sample `app:hello` command to confirm you can execute Laravel Zero commands through the helper:

```bash
./scripts/app-cli app:hello
```

```text
Hello from Phlag!
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
composer test
```

Uses [**PestPHP**](https://pestphp.com/) for expressive tests and [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) for static analysis.

---

## üîÅ Development Workflow (GitHub Flow)

The project follows [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) to coordinate work with Codex Cloud tasks:

1.  Start new work from an up-to-date `main` branch.
2.  Create a feature branch named `issue/<number>-<slug>` (for example, `issue/16-adopt-github-flow`).
3.  Implement the change with small, imperative commits that reference the issue in the commit body or pull request description.
4.  Run validation locally (`composer test`, `composer lint`, `composer stan`, etc.) and capture the output or call out blockers when tooling cannot run (e.g., Composer downloads requiring GitHub tokens).
5.  Open a pull request summarizing the work, linking the issue, and attaching validation evidence (test logs, screenshots, or notes) using the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
6.  After approval, merge via fast-forward or squash, then delete the branch. Follow-up tasks start their own issue and branch.

PR descriptions should also mention any migrations, environment variables, or operational impacts so reviewers can plan rollouts.

---

## üìò API Documentation

-   Auto-generated from annotations (`swagger-php`)
-   OpenAPI JSON: `/v1/docs/openapi.json`
-   Swagger UI: `/docs`
-   Postman Collection: `/postman/FeatureFlagService.postman_collection.json`

Regenerate docs once you have sourced environment variables:

```bash
php api/swagger.php > docs/openapi.json
```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Deployment

The service is intended for local demonstrations:

1. `docker compose up -d --build` to launch the app, PostgreSQL, and Redis on the shared network.
2. Export environment variables from `.env.local` (optional when running host-side tooling).
3. Use `docker compose exec app ...` for Laravel Zero commands so they share the same networking configuration as the HTTP service.

When you are finished experimenting, shut everything down with `docker compose down`.

Need to scale HTTP workers or spawn dedicated CLI worker containers? Follow the patterns documented in `doc/docker-worker-scaling.md`.

### Container runtime details

-   The `app` image pre-installs the PHP extensions required by Laravel + Redis (`pdo_pgsql`, `zip`, and `redis`) and provides `curl` for internal health probes.
-   Docker Compose health checks monitor the `app`, `postgres`, and `redis` services; the application container now waits for the data stores to become healthy before starting its HTTP server.
