# üö¶ Phlag - Feature Flag Service

[![QA Workflow](https://github.com/danhenke/phlag/actions/workflows/qa.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/danhenke/phlag/actions/workflows/qa.yml)

A lightweight, developer-focused **Feature Flag & Remote Configuration API** built with **Laravel Zero**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Redis**. The project runs entirely on a local **Docker Compose** stack so you can experiment with feature flag workflows without provisioning any cloud infrastructure.

Please refer to [`doc/adr`](./doc/adr) for [Architecture Decision Records](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) (ADRs) and [`doc/12-factor-compliance.md`](./doc/12-factor-compliance.md) for the 12-Factor alignment checklist.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker Desktop 4.32.0+ (Engine 26.1.1, Compose 2.27+) on macOS or Windows with virtualization enabled (HyperKit on Apple Silicon, WSL¬†2 on Windows).
- Docker Engine 26.0.0+ with the Compose plugin 2.27+ on Linux; install the `docker-compose-plugin` package provided by your distribution.
- BuildKit enabled for modern Dockerfile syntax. Add the following to `~/.docker/config.json` (see Docker documentation) or export `DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1` before building:

    ```json
    {
        "features": {
            "buildkit": true
        }
    }
    ```

Need more detail? The troubleshooting guide in [`doc/docker-troubleshooting.md`](./doc/docker-troubleshooting.md) covers version checks, disk space tips, and recovery steps.

### 1. Clone & install dependencies

```bash
git clone https://github.com/danhenke/phlag.git
cd phlag
composer install
```

### 2. Create a local environment file

Define the runtime configuration expected by the application:

```bash
cat <<EOF > .env.local
APP_NAME=Phlag
APP_ENV=local
APP_DEBUG=true

POSTGRES_DB=phlag
POSTGRES_USER=postgres
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres

DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_DATABASE=phlag
DB_USERNAME=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DATABASE_URL=pgsql://postgres:postgres@postgres:5432/phlag

REDIS_URL=redis://redis:6379/0
REDIS_CACHE_DB=1
JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
EOF
```

For hosted environments configure RSA signing keys via `JWT_KEY_ID`, `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`, and `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` according to [`doc/adr/0010-manage-jwt-signing-keys.md`](./doc/adr/0010-manage-jwt-signing-keys.md). The `JWT_SECRET` value above is a local-only fallback so contributors can start without managing PEM files. Tune token lifetimes with `JWT_TTL` (seconds, default `3600`) and adjust clock drift tolerance using `JWT_CLOCK_SKEW` (seconds, default `60`).

Load the variables into your shell whenever you start a new terminal:

```bash
set -a
source .env.local
set +a
```

Evaluation caching stores data in Redis database 1 by default. Override `REDIS_CACHE_DB` if multiple Phlag stacks share the same Redis instance.

### 3. Start Docker Compose stack

Ensure Docker Desktop (or another Docker engine) is running. Build (or pull) the application image that Compose will use:

```bash
./scripts/docker-build-app
```

Set `PHLAG_APP_IMAGE` if you want to reuse a different prebuilt tag.

With the image available locally, bring up the full stack defined in `compose.yaml`:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This launches three services within an isolated Docker network:

-   `app` ‚Äî PHP runtime serving HTTP on port 80 and talking to backing services via Docker DNS.
-   `postgres` ‚Äî PostgreSQL database available only on the Compose network.
-   `redis` ‚Äî Redis cache available only on the Compose network.

Only the application‚Äôs port 80 is published to your LAN (`http://localhost/` by default). Re-run `./scripts/docker-build-app` whenever you change PHP dependencies or base layers so the `${PHLAG_APP_IMAGE:-phlag-app:latest}` tag stays in sync with your working tree.

Need to live-edit code inside the container? Add a local override (for example `compose.override.yaml`) that bind-mounts your working tree into `/app`. Remember this bypasses the packaged PHAR and assets that ship with the image, so disable it when you want to validate what will run in other environments.

Logs remain on stdout; tail them with `docker compose logs -f` when debugging. Each HTTP request now emits structured entries including the method, request URI, status code, user agent, and duration so you can correlate activity without enabling verbose framework logging. The Compose file configures the `json-file` driver with `max-size=10m` and `max-file=5`, so each container keeps a rotating local buffer without requiring extra volumes.

#### Quick smoke tests without Docker

Need to hit the HTTP bridge without the full Compose stack? Use the helper script to spin up PHP‚Äôs built-in server directly against your working tree:

```bash
./scripts/app-serve --port 8080
```

The script sources `.env.local` automatically (or a custom file via `--env-file`) and serves `public/index.php` from the current checkout. It‚Äôs handy for verifying basic routes like the health check, but any endpoint that relies on PostgreSQL or Redis will still expect those services to be available locally.

### 4. Run migrations and seed data

Execute CLI commands inside the `app` container so they share networking and environment context. Helper scripts wrap
`docker compose exec` for the common admin tasks when your stack is running detached:

```bash
./scripts/app-migrate --seed
# or when you just need to reload demo data
./scripts/app-seed --fresh
```

The seeders provision a reusable dataset:

-   Project `demo-project` with Production (default) and Staging environments.
-   Feature flags `checkout-redesign` and `homepage-recommendations`.
-   Sample evaluation and audit records that exercise the schema.

### 5. Verify the HTTP endpoint and CLI

-   Visit `http://localhost/` to confirm the container is serving traffic.
-   List available console commands from inside the container:

    ```bash
    docker compose exec app php phlag list
    ```

| `GET /v1/projects/{project}`                | Retrieve a single project                       |
| `PATCH /v1/projects/{project}`              | Update a project                                |
| `DELETE /v1/projects/{project}`             | Delete a project                                |

### Postman collection

1. Import `postman/FeatureFlagService.postman_collection.json` into Postman (Collections ‚Üí Import ‚Üí File) to load ready-made requests for each API.
2. Review the collection variables. `baseUrl` defaults to `http://localhost`, `projectKey`, `environmentKey`, and `flagKey` point at the demo seed data, and `apiKey` must be set to the credential you minted via `PHLAG_DEMO_API_KEY`.
3. Send `Authentication ‚Üí Exchange API key for JWT` to populate the `bearerToken` variable automatically; subsequent requests reuse it for Authorization headers.
4. Work through the domain folders (Projects, Environments, Flags, Evaluations, Audit) to exercise CRUD flows and flag evaluation. The Audit folder documents the planned `GET /v1/audit-events` endpoint and will respond once that API ships.

### Error responses

All API errors return a consistent envelope so clients can display human-friendly messages and branch on machine-readable codes:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "validation_failed",
        "message": "Validation failed for the submitted payload.",
        "status": 422,
        "violations": [
            {
                "field": "key",
                "message": "The key field is required."
            }
        ],
        "context": {
            "endpoint": "POST /v1/projects"
        }
    }
}
```

Common `code` values include:

- `validation_failed` ‚Äì payload validation errors (see `violations`)
- `resource_not_found` ‚Äì missing models or routes
- `method_not_allowed` ‚Äì unsupported HTTP verbs on the endpoint
- `unauthorized` / `forbidden` ‚Äì authentication or authorization failures
- `server_error` ‚Äì unexpected exceptions (original message returns in `detail` only when `APP_DEBUG=true`)

### Example: Exchange an API key for a JWT

```bash
curl --request POST \
     --url http://localhost/v1/auth/token \
     --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
     --data '{
         "project": "demo-project",
         "environment": "production",
         "api_key": "<project-environment-api-key>"
     }'
```

```json
{
    "token": "<jwt-token>",
    "token_type": "Bearer",
    "expires_in": 3600,
    "project": "demo-project",
    "environment": "production",
    "roles": [
        "project.maintainer"
    ],
    "permissions": [
        "projects.read",
        "projects.manage",
        "environments.read",
        "environments.manage",
        "flags.read",
        "flags.manage",
        "flags.evaluate",
        "cache.warm"
    ]
}
```

### Example: List seeded projects and environments

After running the demo seeders you can inspect the REST payloads with a simple `curl`:

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'http://localhost/v1/projects' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt>'
```

```json
{
    "data": [
        {
            "id": "11111111-1111-4111-9111-111111111111",
            "key": "demo-project",
            "name": "Phlag Demo Project",
            "description": "Sample project used to showcase feature flag workflows.",
            "metadata": {
                "owner": "demo@phlag.test",
                "timezone": "UTC"
            },
            "environments": [
                {
                    "id": "22222222-2222-4222-9222-222222222222",
                    "key": "production",
                    "name": "Production",
                    "is_default": true
                },
                {
                    "id": "33333333-3333-4333-9333-333333333333",
                    "key": "staging",
                    "name": "Staging",
                    "is_default": false
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Example: Evaluate a feature flag for a user

```bash
curl --request GET \
     --url 'http://localhost/v1/evaluate?project=demo-project&env=production&flag=checkout-redesign&user_id=user-123&country=US&segment=beta-testers' \
     --header 'Authorization: Bearer <jwt>'
```

```json
{
    "flag": "checkout-redesign",
    "variant": "variant",
    "rollout": 75,
    "reason": "matched_segment_rollout",
    "request_context": {
        "country": "US",
        "segment": "beta-testers"
    }
}
```

## üîê Authentication

-   JWT bearer tokens issued via `POST /v1/auth/token` using the project/environment API key payload (`project`, `environment`, `api_key`).
-   Include header:
    ```
    Authorization: Bearer <jwt>
    ```
-   All `/v1` project, environment, flag, and evaluation endpoints enforce the bearer guard; requests without a valid token receive the standardized `unauthenticated` error envelope.
-   When invoking helper scripts that hit the HTTP bridge (for example, `curl` or automation workflows warming caches), forward the same bearer token so calls succeed alongside the CLI.
-   Tokens are scoped to project + environment.
-   Define `PHLAG_DEMO_API_KEY` before seeding to mint a demo credential for `demo-project` / `production`; rotate or remove it after validation.
-   Responses include the bearer `token_type` plus the default roles granted to project clients so consumers can reason about access.
-   Key rotation expectations and supported environment variables are documented in [`doc/adr/0010-manage-jwt-signing-keys.md`](./doc/adr/0010-manage-jwt-signing-keys.md).

## üß∞ CLI Commands (Laravel Zero)

| Command                          | Purpose                 |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `app:migrate [--fresh] [--seed]` | Run database migrations |
| `app:seed [--fresh]`             | Seed demo data          |
| `app:hello`                      | Print a hello message   |
| `api-key:create`                 | Generate a project API key |

Run commands through the Laravel Zero binary inside the running container via the helper script:

```bash
./scripts/app-cli app:migrate
```

### Example: Run migrations and seed the demo dataset

Use the helper to execute Laravel Zero commands in the app container and mirror what CI does before tests run:

```bash
./scripts/app-migrate --seed
```

This wraps `docker compose exec app php phlag app:migrate --seed` and surfaces the same confirmation messages you would see by running the binary directly:

```
Database migrations completed.
Database seeding completed.
```

### Example: Refresh demo data from a clean schema

```bash
./scripts/app-seed --fresh
```

The command drops and recreates the schema before seeding so you always have the canonical records from `database/seeders/DatabaseSeeder.php`:

```
Database seeding completed.
```

> Set `PHLAG_DEMO_API_KEY=<your-demo-api-key>` in `.env.local` before seeding if you want the demo project to include an API credential for immediate JWT issuance.

### Example: Create a project API key

```bash
./scripts/api-key-create
```

The helper wraps `api-key:create` via the Laravel Zero binary. Follow the interactive prompts to select the project, environment, credential name, roles (comma separated, press enter for the default assignment), and an optional expiration timestamp. The command prints a 48-character API key exactly once‚Äîcopy it to your password manager or secret store. Only the SHA-256 hash, metadata, and expiration live in Postgres (`api_credentials` table); the plaintext key is never persisted.

Current roles and their bundled permissions:

| Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| `project.viewer` | `projects.read`, `environments.read`, `flags.read`, `flags.evaluate`
| `environment.operator` | `environments.read`, `flags.read`, `flags.evaluate`, `cache.warm`
| `project.maintainer` (default) | all viewer/operator permissions plus `projects.manage`, `environments.manage`, `flags.manage`

Specify one or more roles per credential to constrain API tokens. When no roles are entered, credentials receive the `project.maintainer` profile, matching the full-control behavior prior to RBAC.

If an existing credential requires more granular access than the predefined roles, the migration preserves those scopes as explicit permissions. New role assignments will continue to work the same way‚ÄîJWTs always include the effective permission list so downstream services can enforce the exact capabilities that were granted.

### Example: Warm flag caches for a project

```bash
./scripts/app-cache-warm demo-project production
```

Provide the project and environment keys to repopulate Redis after changing flag rules. The warmer regenerates the snapshot stored at `flag:snapshot:{project}:{environment}` and replays historical evaluations to seed the per-user cache keys so the next request hits Redis instead of Postgres. Pass additional options (for example, `--daemon`) and they are forwarded to the underlying `cache:warm` command.

#### Tune Redis cache TTLs

Control how long snapshots and evaluations stay in Redis without code changes:

-   `FLAG_CACHE_SNAPSHOT_TTL` ‚Äî defaults to `300` seconds.
-   `FLAG_CACHE_EVALUATION_TTL` ‚Äî defaults to `300` seconds.

Set the environment variables in `.env.local` (or your deployment secrets) to align with the guidance in [`doc/adr/0011-invalidate-redis-caches.md`](./doc/adr/0011-invalidate-redis-caches.md).

### Example: Tail audit events

```bash
./scripts/app-audit-tail --project=demo-project --env=production
```

Use the helper to follow recent audit entries without typing the full `docker compose exec` invocation. All flags are passed directly to the `audit:tail` CLI command.

### Example: Verify the CLI wiring inside the container

Use the sample `app:hello` command to confirm you can execute Laravel Zero commands through the helper:

```bash
./scripts/app-cli app:hello
```

```text
Hello from Phlag!
```

## üß™ Testing

```bash
composer test
```

Uses [**PestPHP**](https://pestphp.com/) for expressive tests and [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org/) for static analysis.

## üîÅ Development Workflow (GitHub Flow)

The project follows [GitHub Flow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow) to coordinate work with Codex Cloud tasks:

1.  Start new work from an up-to-date `main` branch.
2.  Create a feature branch named `issue/<number>-<slug>` (for example, `issue/16-adopt-github-flow`).
3.  Implement the change with small, imperative commits that reference the issue in the commit body or pull request description.
4.  Run validation locally (`composer test`, `composer lint`, `composer stan`, etc.) and capture the output or call out blockers when tooling cannot run (e.g., Composer downloads requiring GitHub tokens).
5.  Open a pull request summarizing the work, linking the issue, and attaching validation evidence (test logs, screenshots, or notes) using the template in `.github/pull_request_template.md`.
6.  After approval, merge via fast-forward or squash, then delete the branch. Follow-up tasks start their own issue and branch.

PR descriptions should also mention any migrations, environment variables, or operational impacts so reviewers can plan rollouts.

## üìò API Documentation

-   Auto-generated from annotations (`swagger-php`)
-   OpenAPI JSON: `/v1/openapi.json`
-   Swagger UI: `/docs`
-   Postman Collection: `/v1/postman.json`

Regenerate docs once you have sourced environment variables; the API endpoint will serve the generated artifact and returns a 404 if it is missing:

```bash
composer openapi:generate
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Deployment

The service is intended for local demonstrations:

1. `./scripts/docker-build-app` to build or refresh the `${PHLAG_APP_IMAGE:-phlag-app:latest}` image (skip if you are pointing `PHLAG_APP_IMAGE` at a prebuilt tag).
2. `docker compose up -d` to launch the app, PostgreSQL, and Redis on the shared network.
3. Export environment variables from `.env.local` (optional when running host-side tooling).
4. Use `docker compose exec app ...` for Laravel Zero commands so they share the same networking configuration as the HTTP service.

When you are finished experimenting, shut everything down with `docker compose down`.

Need to scale HTTP workers or spawn dedicated CLI worker containers? Scale the `app` service with `docker compose up -d --scale app=<count>` or create a short-lived override file that defines additional services before starting the stack.

### Container runtime details

-   The `app` image pre-installs the PHP extensions required by Laravel + Redis (`pdo_pgsql`, `zip`, and `redis`) and provides `curl` for internal health probes.
-   Docker Compose health checks monitor the `app`, `postgres`, and `redis` services; the application container now waits for the data stores to become healthy before starting its HTTP server.

## üì¶ Docker image workflow

-   Build locally with `./scripts/docker-build-app` (defaults to tagging `phlag-app:local-<sha>` and `phlag-app:latest`).
-   Re-run `./scripts/docker-build-app` whenever you change dependencies or base layers so the local image reflects your working tree.
-   Set `PHLAG_APP_IMAGE` to reuse a previously built tag (for example, when switching between branches or exchanging archives with teammates).
